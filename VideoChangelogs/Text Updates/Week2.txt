I added a component based system for the entities. I no longer would have to copy and paste 30+ lines and change them to work with the specific entity I want. Now all I have to do is call EntityName.usesGravity(true); to have an entity fall with gravity, and EntityName.isDynamic(true); for an entity to be movable by the player. I also connected my project to a GitProject to easily save different versions.

If you wish, the main project files can be viewed here, with the source code being shown here.
