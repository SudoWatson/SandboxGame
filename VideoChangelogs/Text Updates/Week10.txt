Week10: Animations Complete

- Finished implementation of basic animation system
- Animations are properly transformed
- Bug with the size of an XML model; Can be hack-fixed by hard-scaling model in-engine
- Ability to pause, resume, fully stop, or begin playing an animation
- Able to change the speed the animation runs at
- Animation ending options: Loop, pause
- 'AnimatedModel' now extends 'Model' without repetition
- Issue: XMLObjects are loaded twice; Potential fix, load a false model into the parent 'Entity' constructor and true model into the 'AnimatedEntity' constructor (or vise versa)

- Fixed Player walking animation
- Added Tree falling animation
- Trees fall over when clicked on
